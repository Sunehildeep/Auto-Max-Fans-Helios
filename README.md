# Auto Max Fans - Helios 300
### This little program allows you to customize fan temperature threshold automatically so that when the laptop overheats, it goes to max fans and back to auto when it cools down. 

### Important
You need to be on "auto" fan mode in predator sense or it will not work. It has been made that way so that if user is on Turbo mode or on custom fan mode, it won't interrupt and change anything. Right now the temperature threshold is set at 78C for GPU and 80C for CPU.  This range worked the best for me. Doesn't let it get too hot and cools down in time

### Features
- CPU and GPU temperature threshold customization
- Both fans work independently
- Ability to enable or disable either of the fan in the program
- GUI to control everything
