# automaxfans-helios
##This little program allows the helios 300 (ph315-53) laptop to go max fans when it is overheating and back to auto fans when it's normal.
## It is set to detect to go max fans if GPU temperature is above 77 and CPU temperature is above 80. If not, it will revert to automatic fan mode. It will only work if fans are set to auto mode in Predator Sense.
